# JavaScript Data Structures & Algorithms

This repository contains complete JavaScript implementations of **fundamental and advanced data structures and algorithms**, following the [roadmap.sh Data Structures & Algorithms guide](https://roadmap.sh/datastructures-and-algorithms).
The goal is to provide **clear, production-level implementations** for professionals, while also serving as a solid educational reference.

## Description

The project includes:

* Full implementations of **Stacks, Queues, Linked Lists, Trees, Sorting algorithms, Graph traversal**, and more.
* Complete coverage of:

  * **Stack** – Implemented using arrays and linked lists.
  * **Queue** – Implemented using arrays, linked lists, and a priority queue.
  * **Linked List** – Singly, Doubly, and Circular linked lists.
  * **Sorting algorithms** – Quick Sort, Merge Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Bubble Sort, Heap Sort.
  * **Patterns** – Numeric, star, and other console-based patterns.
  * **Trees** – Binary Search Tree (BST), B-Tree, B+ Tree, AVL Tree.
* Upcoming advanced data structures:

  * Trie
  * Segment Tree
  * Fenwick Tree (Binary Indexed Tree)
  * Suffix Array & Suffix Tree

## Interesting Techniques Used

* [**Recursion**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Recursion) for traversal and divide-and-conquer algorithms.
* **Multiple data structure implementations** for Stack and Queue:

  * [Array-based](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array) operations.
  * Linked list–based approaches.
  * [Priority Queue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Priority_queue) implementation.
* **Graph traversal**:

  * [Breadth-First Search (BFS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search)
  * [Depth-First Search (DFS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth-first_search)
* [**Hash Table**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object) with collision handling.
* Full suite of [**sorting algorithms**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/sort) from O(n²) to O(n log n).
* **Tree algorithms** for insertion, deletion, search, balancing, and range queries.

## Non-Obvious Technologies / Libraries

* Pure **ES6+ JavaScript**.
* No frameworks — all algorithms are implemented from scratch.
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) for running and testing code.
